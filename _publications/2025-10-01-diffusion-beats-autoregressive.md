This paper presents a comparative study on Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) and Autoregressive Models in data-constrained scenarios. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of MDMs in learning from limited data and mitigating overfitting. We are also constructing a data-constrained scaling law for MDMs.
